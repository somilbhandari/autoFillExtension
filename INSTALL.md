## Setup n8n Webhook Response

‚úÖ **Your current setup works!** The extension sends data to:
`https://somil.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/14591d83-e679-486d-a00e-1ab2e05e9894`

**Configure your n8n workflow to:**

1. **Set Webhook method to GET** in your Webhook node
2. **Receive the URL** as a query parameter: `{{ $request.query.url }}`
3. **Process the URL** (scrape, analyze, extract data, etc.)
4. **Return the processed data** directly in your "Respond to Webhook" node

**‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:**
- If you get "Authorization data is wrong!", check your webhook authentication settings in n8n
- Make sure the webhook is set to GET method, not POST
- Verify the webhook is active and published

**Response format should be:**
```json
{
  "Name of Business": "Blue Horizon Ventures LLC",
  "DBA Name": "Horizon Foods",
  "Website URL": "https://www.horizonfoods.com",
  "Primary Address": {
    "Street": "742 Elmwood Drive",
    "City": "Austin",
    "State": "TX",
    "ZIP": "73301"
  },
  "First Name": "Jessica",
  "Last Name": "Carpenter",
  "Phone Number": "+1-512-555-8923",
  "Email": "jessica.carpenter@horizonfoods.com",
  "Annual revenue": 1250000
}
```

2. Enter a test URL (e.g., https://google.com)
3. Click "Process URL"
